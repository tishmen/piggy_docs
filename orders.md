**Coming soon!** The _Orders_ API is set to release in May 2025. The endpoints on this page are not yet available.

## Orders

Orders are replicas of the orders generated by external software (e.g. web shops, ordering apps, POS systems, kiosks et cetera), to be used by Leat as the driving force behind our Loyalty, Marketing, Data and Automation tools. In the Leat dashboard, clients can setup Actions to be triggered after the successful creation of an Order in the Leat system. This can result in Leat objects such as a Points Transaction or a Prepaid Transaction.

### New conventions

**Please note:** this API call uses conventions that will be used in the V4 version of our API and from this points onwards. If you're already familiar with our API, take note of the following:

Relevant changes

- **'business\_profile' instead of 'shop':** This entity has already been renamed in the Leat dashboard for some time now and will be named as such in API calls.
- **Refactor of Credit Receptions:** As part of a larger refactor of the core of our Loyalty engine, some new entities have been introduced, whilst others have been renamed. For this particular API, this means a `points_transaction` will be returned as a result instead of `credit_reception`.
- **Input parameters:** For previous API endpoints, input parameters like a Contact's UUID were given as `contact_uuid`. In this newest endpoint, an object is expected instead.

### Create Order

Creates a new Order in the Leat system and returns both the Order entity itself and a result object. If an Order Action was configured for the Account, then this is executed in sync and will fill the result object. An example of such a result would be a transaction containing loyalty points.

**Note:** This endpoint is not yet live and is here for reference only, and **may be subject to change**.
