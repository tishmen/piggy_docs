## Contact Verification

If you already have a verification method in your own application â€“ either through login, a saved uuid, magic link etc. - we recommend you use that one instead.

Business owners use the Piggy system to send out a verification email to their Contacts whenever a Contact wants to login to the business owner's Contacts Portal. This verification is configured in the Business Dashboard and sends out a code, which the Contact in question needs to fill in.

For integrations lacking a method to authenticate email addresses or Contacts, the API provides a solution for sending verification emails and validating the received code.

### Send Contact Verification Email

This function triggers the sending of a verification email to a Contact, provided they exist in the system. Therefore, it requires the Contact's email address to proceed. When doing so, the process of verifying their identity through email validation is initiated.

The system checks for the existence of the Contact and the associated Contacts Portal before sending the email. If the Contact is not found or if the Contacts Portal is missing, the process will not proceed.
